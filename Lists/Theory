Lists are mutable, meaning that their contents can change. Tuples and
strings, although list-like in some respects, are immutable and cannot be
changed. A variable that contains a tuple or string value can be overwritten
with a new tuple or string value, but this is not the same thing as modifying
the existing value in placeâ€”like, say, the append() or remove() methods do on
lists.
Variables do not store list values directly; they store references to lists.
This is an important distinction when copying variables or passing lists as
arguments in function calls. Because the value that is being copied is the
list reference, be aware that any changes you make to the list might impact
another variable in your program. You can use copy() or deepcopy() if you
want to make changes to a list in one variable without modifying the origi-
nal list.
