1.The print() function displays the string value inside the parenthese on the screen.

for example:
print('Hello world!')
print('What is your name?')

it can also use this function to put a blank line on the screen; just call print() with
nothing in between the parentheses.

2.The input() function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press Enter

for example:
myName = input()

the input() function call as an expression that evaluates to whatever string the user typed in.

3.We can pass the len() function a string value (or a variable containing a string), and the function evaluates to an integer value of the number of characters in that string.

for example:
print('The length of your name is:')
print(len(myName))
