Errors can be handled with try and except statements.The code that could potentially have an error is put in a **try** clause.
The program execution moves to the start of a following except clause if an error happens.
When code in a try clause causes an error, the program execution immediately moves to the code in the except clause(block).
After running that code, the execution continues as normal.
